## Introduction
Source code for FocalSleepNet developed for the paper "Temporal Focal Modulation Networks for Sleep Stage Scoring"

## Description
The model was trained and evaluated on Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)

The architecture of FocalSleepNet:
...

## Training
The model can be trained from scratch using the Jupyter notebook: `main.ipynb` Note that PSG data and labels should be downloaded from https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/ . 

## Evaluation
Model can be evaluated the Jupyter notebooks: `main.ipynb` after training or loading weights. Weights of the pre-trained model can be found in https://github.com/hasanzan/FocalSleepNet/.
